Since this is a web-based project, the primary testing methods include:

Manual Testing:
Checking if the UI/UX is intuitive and easy to use.
Ensuring all forms and buttons function properly (e.g., adding expenses, submitting the form).
Cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility with modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Unit Testing (if backend is used):
Testing individual components of the Node.js server (using Mocha/Chai or Jest for testing routes and functionality).

User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Conducted by a small group of end-users to identify potential usability issues and gather feedback.
